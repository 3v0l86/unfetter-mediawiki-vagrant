 \  -;'|       |  This directory is mounted as '/vagrant/settings.d' in the

       |-------|
       |    J  |  As an alternative to managing all MediaWiki settings in a
       |    |  |  single large file, consider grouping your configurations by
       |    ;  |  component or theme, and creating a separate PHP file for
       |   /|  \  each group. This makes it quite easy to keep your settings
       | _/ T  /  organized, to temporarily disable specific configurations,
       |  | |  |  and to share settings with others.
       |  | |__|_
       |__| '-.__)  Because the files are loaded in lexical order, you can
  jgs  \__)        control the order in which your configurations are set by
            adopting the habit of adding a two-digit prefix to each file name.

    For example:

        settings.d/
        ├── 10-RunFirst.php
        ├── 20-SomeExtension.php
        └── 99-RunLast.php

The file '00-debug.php-example' in this directory is included as an example. It
contains settings that are useful for debugging and development work. To use
it, simply copy '00-debug.php-example' to '00-debug.php', omitting the
'-example' suffix.

Note that the settings files in settings.d/puppet-managed are automatically
created and destroyed by Puppet in response to your Puppet configuration. Don't
put your custom settings there, because Puppet will erase or override them.
Keep your custom settings files in this directory instead. Settings files in
this directory will load *after* any Puppet-managed files, so you can override
any unwanted settings that are set by Puppet.

If you are using a multiwiki setup, please note that puppet-managed settings
specific to each wiki can only be overridden by configuration in:
	settings.d/wikis/<dbname>/settings.d/*.php
