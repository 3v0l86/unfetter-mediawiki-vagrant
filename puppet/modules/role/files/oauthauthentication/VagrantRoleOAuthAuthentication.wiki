Use Wikimedia identities to log in. This uses a predefined consumer
([https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:OAuthListConsumers/view/7e5461e6907ad6ed43684793046fd3a9 7e5461e6907ad6ed43684793046fd3a9])
and the secret key of that consumer is part of the MediaWiki-Vagrant
code and thus public, which makes it somewhat insecure. It should
be good enough for development, though (the consumer does not have
permissions to do anything, and the only information it can leak 
is the fact that you have authorized it).

The Vagrant box must be available at the IP address 127.0.0.1 for the
role to work (the port number can be arbitrary).
